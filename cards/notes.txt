Slice range syntax.

- to specify a range in a Slice

slice[startIndexIncluding : upToNotIncluding]

fruits[0:2] will give us the 0 and 1 index of the slice.

leaving off the first argument [:2] will be interpreted as going from the start.
leaving off the last [2:] will give us everything from the first index specified to the end.
