Slice range syntax.

- to specify a range in a Slice

slice[startIndexIncluding : upToNotIncluding]

fruits[0:2] will give us the 0 and 1 index of the slice.

leaving off the first argument [:2] will be interpreted as going from the start.
leaving off the last [2:] will give us everything from the first index specified to the end. 

-- converting strings to byte slices

Built in libaries in go often take in byte slices instead of strings.

it can be done simply by []byte(string) to convert the data type.

-- basic error handling
 
 what to we want to do when there is an error?

 // structs

 data structures for collections of properties that are gathered together

 // go is known as a pass by value language
 when we reassign it is not mutating the original struct, but 
 copying it and putting it in a new place in memory

 we use interfaces to define a method set. Anything that matches the description in the interface becomes part of the declared type
