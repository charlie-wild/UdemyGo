- arrays are primitive data structures that cannot be resized. 
- most of the time we will use slices.

slices are stored as arrays in memory. when we copy a slice, we talk to the original array!

even though the slice data structure is being copied, its pointing at the same 
array in memory. 

/value/ types need pointers if we are going to modify them.
int, float, string, bool, struct

/reference/ types don't. 
slices, maps, channels, pointers, functions
